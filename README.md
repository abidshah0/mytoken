# Solidity
I am demonstrating the codes i have learnt fom METACRAFTERS
ie, 'How to create and Deploy a Token named "ELIZA" in to the Blockchain' 
and then mint some tokens using mint function and later burning those tokens using the burn function

# Public Variables
Starting with assigning the name and abbrevation of the token using string variable
# Mapping Variable
This part means that if the address is given by any user it should display back the balance amount of tokens.

# Mint Function
This function is used to add or generate more tokens to the total supply of that token.
# Burn Function
use to burn or destroy tokens from the total supply of that token. provide 'if' inorder to avoid burning tokens more than the total supply.
